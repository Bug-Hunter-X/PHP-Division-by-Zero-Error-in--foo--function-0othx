# PHP Division by Zero Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: division by zero. The `foo` function is designed to divide two numbers but does not handle the case where the second number is zero, which causes a runtime error.

A solution is also provided that gracefully handles the division by zero scenario using a simple conditional check.
